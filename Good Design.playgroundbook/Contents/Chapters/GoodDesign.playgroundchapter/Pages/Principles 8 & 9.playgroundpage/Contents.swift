 175-acres, carefully designed from the massive trees to the patented pizza boxes in the restaurant. One of the greenest buildings ever built by humankind, powered 100% by renewable energy and cooled by the world's most extensive natural ventilation system. I think the Ô£øPark is the combination of principles 8 and 9 in pure perfection.
  
 * Callout(Take a look):
 To grasp a sense of the extreme perfectionism that went into designing the Ô£øPark, you can call the function `showAppleParkAspect(_:)`. Possible parameters are `.solarRoof`, `.steveJobsTheater`, and `.patentedPizzaBox` üçï
