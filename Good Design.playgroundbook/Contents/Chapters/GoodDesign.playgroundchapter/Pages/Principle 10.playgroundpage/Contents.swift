 # 10 â€“ Good design is as little design as possible
 *Less, but better â€“ because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the products are not burdened with non-essentials.*
 
 *Back to purity, back to simplicity.*

 After all, the 10th principle for good design might be the most important in Dieter Rams' design philosophy. The first things most people associate with Apple are minimalism, simplicity, and perfection. I think you can derive all the other principles out of this principle.
  
 That said, I genuinely hope that you had fun with my playground and maybe learned more about the fundamentals of good design! ðŸ˜Š
